What is an antigen?\u00a0\nAntigens are proteins that are part of the COVID-19 virus. If the test detects antigens in your swab sample, it means that the COVID-19 virus is present in your body.\u00a0\nQ. What is the difference between a molecular, antigen and antibody test?\u00a0\nThere are three main types of COVID-19 tests. Molecular tests (also known as PCR tests) detect the genetic material of the coronavirus. The Panbio\u2122 COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test is an antigen test. Antigen tests detect coronavirus proteins. Antibody tests detect antibodies produced by your body\u2018s immune system in response to a previous COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose an active COVID-19 infection.\u00a0\nQ. Will this test hurt?\n\u00a0\nThe nasal swab may cause slight discomfort. It is important to follow the nasal swab collection steps as indicated in the procedure. Discomfort may occur if the swab is inserted beyond the recommended depth. If painful, slightly withdraw the swab to finish the sample collection process.\nQ. How accurate is the test?\nThe Panbio\u2122 COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test has been shown in clinical evaluations, performed by healthcare professionals, to correctly identify 98.1% of positive specimens and 99.8% of negative specimens.\u00a0\nQ. Can this test be used on children?\nThe test can be used for all ages. Children under 14 years old should be supported by an adult.\u00a0\nQ. Will this test tell me if I have been infected with COVID-19 in the past?\u00a0\nNo, this is an antigen test that only detects an active infection. Antibody tests can detect past infections.\u00a0\nQ. Does the product expire?\nThe test has an expiration date printed on the box, and should not be used after that date.\nQ. Can I use my own swab or other swabs?\nNo - only use the components included in the test kit.\nQ. I'm pregnant. Can I use the test?\n\u00a0\nYes. Pregnancy had no impact on the performance of the test, as described in the \"Which interferences can occur?\" section in the Instructions for Use.\u00a0\nQ. Does this test detect the new variants?\nAbbott is intently monitoring the mutations of the COVID-19 virus so we can ensure our tests can detect them, as we do with many viruses. We have conducted a thorough analysis of known variants that we\u2019ve been able to study, and we are confident that our tests remain effective at identifying these strains.\u00a0\u00a0\nQ. Can I use this test more than once?\nNo \u2013 each test can only be used once.\nQ. How do I dispose of a used test?\n\u00a0\nPlace the swab, tube, and test device into the included disposal bag. Seal the bag tightly. Throw away the bag in a waste bin.\nQ. What does it mean if I have a positive result?\nA positive test result means that proteins of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been found in your nasal swab sample. It is likely that you will need to perform self-isolation at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A positive result does not rule out coinfection with other pathogens. Please follow local guidelines for social distancing to limit the spread of the virus and contact your doctor or local health department immediately.\u00a0\nQ. What does it mean if I have a negative result?\nA negative test result means that it is unlikely that you have COVID-19 at the time of testing. The test did not detect any antigens in your nasal swab sample, but it is possible that your test gave a false-negative test result. False-negative test results can be caused by several factors: The amount of antigen in the swab sample may decrease over the duration of the infection. The test may be negative before you develop symptoms. The test was not performed per the instructions. Specimen collection, extraction or transport was not performed correctly.\nQ. I'm feeling unwell but my test is negative. What should I do?\n\u00a0\nIf symptoms continue and the rapid antigen test results are negative, individuals should immediately be tested by RT-PCR per ICMR Advisory, as the coronavirus may not be detectable in the very early phases of infection.\u00a0You are also advised to continue following local guidelines for self-isolation and consult your doctor.\u00a0\nVisit Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India https://www.mohfw.gov.in"

We have conducted a thorough analysis of known variants that we\u2019ve been able to study, and we are confident that our tests remain effective at identifying these strains.\u00a0\u00a0\nQ. Can I use this test more than once?\nNo \u2013 each test can only be used once.\nQ. How do I dispose of a used test?\n\u00a0\nPlace the swab, tube, and test device into the included disposal bag. Seal the bag tightly. Throw away the bag in a waste bin.\nQ. What does it mean if I have a positive result?\nA positive test result means that proteins of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been found in your nasal swab sample. It is likely that you will need to perform self-isolation at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A positive result does not rule out coinfection with other pathogens. Please follow local guidelines for social distancing to limit the spread of the virus and contact your doctor or local health department immediately.\u00a0\nQ. What does it mean if I have a negative result?\nA negative test result means that it is unlikely that you have COVID-19 at the time of testing. The test did not detect any antigens in your nasal swab sample, but it is possible that your test gave a false-negative test result. False-negative test results can be caused by several factors: The amount of antigen in the swab sample may decrease over the duration of the infection. The test may be negative before you develop symptoms. The test was not performed per the instructions. Specimen collection, extraction or transport was not performed correctly.\nQ. I'm feeling unwell but my test is negative. What should I do?\n\u00a0\nIf symptoms continue and the rapid antigen test results are negative, individuals should immediately be tested by RT-PCR per ICMR Advisory, as the coronavirus may not be detectable in the very early phases of infection.\u00a0You are also advised to continue following local guidelines for self-isolation and consult your doctor.\u00a0\nVisit Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India https://www.mohfw.gov.in"

            "description": "Alpine Biomedicals Covid 19 Rapid Antigen Test Kit\nThe novel coronaviruses belong to the \u03b2 genus. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infectious disease. People are generally susceptible. Currently, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the primary source of infection; asymptomatic infected people can also be an infectious source. Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days. The main manifestations include fever, fatigue and dry cough. Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhoea are found in a few cases.\nTest Principle:\nCoronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses distributed broadly among humans, birds and other mammals that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. Alpine One-Step COVID-19 Antigen test is an antigen-capture immunochromatographic assay, detecting the presence of COVID 19 viral nucleoprotein antigen in the nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab sample. This assay utilizes the chemical extraction of viral antigens followed by solid-phase immunoassay technology to detect extracted antigen COVID-19 Monoclonal antibodies specifically against COVID-19 antigen are conjugated with colloidal gold, deposited on the conjugate pad, and immobilized on the Test Zone of the nitrocellulose membrane.\nWhen a simple is added, the gold-antibody conjugate is rehydrated, and the COVID-19 antigen, if any in the sample, will interact with the gold conjugated antibodies. The antigen antibody-gold complex will migrate towards the test window until the Test Zone, where they will be captured by immobilized antibodies, forming a visible pink line (Test band) indicative of a positive result. If COVID-19 antigen is absent in the sample, no pink line will appear in the Test Zone (T). To serve as internal process control, a control band was designed to indicate that the test is performed properly.\nUses:\nThis kit is used to determine whether an individual has an active Covid-19 infection.\nProduct Specification and Features:\nThe test can determine if you have an active COVID-19 infection and provides test results in just 15-20 minutes\nThe results, along with other information, can help your healthcare provider make informed decisions about your treatment\nYou can help limit the spread of COVID-19 by knowing your infection status and taking appropriate social distancing measures\nEasy, self-use nasal swab for sample collection\nKit contents:\nNasopharyngeal swab\nPrefiled Antigen extraction buffer tube\nTest card\nInstruction for use\nDirections For Use:\nSpecimen collection and preparation-\nNasal Swab:\nLet the patient's head relax naturally, and slowly rotate the swab against the wall of the nostril into the patient's nostril to the nasal palate, and then slowly remove it while wiping\nUsing the same swab, wipe the other nostril in the same way; place the swab specimen in the extraction tube with the extraction solution added in advance, rotate the swab for about 10 seconds and press the swab head against the tube wall to release the swab antigen\nTest procedure:\nOpen the package and take out the test card\nPlace the prefilled buffer extraction tube on the workbench\nPut the swab specimen into the extraction tube, rotate the swab for about 10 seconds, and press the swab head against the tube wall to release the antigen in the swab\nSqueeze the swab over the head to remove the swab so as to remove as much liquid as possible from the swab. Dispose of swabs according to biohazard waste disposal method\nInstall the nozzle on the extraction tube, put 2 (two) drops into the specimen hole of the test card, and start the timer\nRead the results within 15 minutes. Strong positive results can be reported within 15 minutes, however, negative results must be reported after 15 minutes, and the results after 20 minutes are no longer valid\nInterpretation of results:\nNegative:\nIf only the C line is present, the absence of burgundy colour in the T line indicates that no Coronavirus antigen is detected. The result is negative\nPositive:\nIn addition to the presence of the C-line, if T line is developed, the test indicates the presence of Coronavirus antigen has been detected\nThe result is positive samples with reactive results should be confirmed with alternative testing method(s) and clinical samples with reactive results should be confirmed with alternative testing\nmethod(s) and clinical findings before a positive determination is made\nInvalid:\nIf no C line is developed, the assay is invalid regardless of the burgundy colour in the test line\nSafety Information:\nRead the instructions carefully before using the kit, and strictly control the reaction time. If you do not follow the instructions, you will get inaccurate results\nThe specimen shall be tested in a laboratory with certain conditions. All specimens and materials during testing should be handled in accordance with the laboratory practice for infectious diseases\nGuard against moisture, do not open the aluminium platinum bag before it is ready for testing\nDo not use the aluminium foil bag when it is damaged or the test card is damp\nPlease use it within the validity period\nBalance all reagents and specimens to room temperature (15-30 ) before use\nDo not replace the components in this kit with components in other kits\nDo not dilute the specimen for testing, otherwise, you may get inaccurate results\nThe kit shall be stored in strict accordance with the conditions specified in this manual. Please do not store the kit under freezing conditions\nThe test methods and results must be interpreted in strict accordance with this specification\nNegative results will occur with this kit if the novel coronavirus antigen titer in the specimen falls. below the minimum detection limit for this kit\nDo not smoke, drink or eat in areas where specimens or kit reagents are being handled\nDispose of all specimens and materials used to perform the test as biohazardous waste\nDo not perform the test in a room with strong airflow, i.e. an electric fan or strong air conditioning\nLimitations of the test:\nThis reagent is only used for in vitro diagnosis\nThis reagent is only used to detect human nasopharyngeal swab extracts\nThe results of other specimens may be wrong. coronavirus antigen in the specimen\nThis reagent is only used for qualitative detection and cannot indicate the level of novel\nThis reagent is only a clinical auxiliary diagnostic tool. If the result is positive, it is recommended to use other methods for further examination in time and the doctor's diagnosis shall prevail\nA negative result may occur if the level of extracted antigen in a specimen is below the sensitivity of the test or if a poor-quality specimen is obtained\nA negative result may occur if the concentration of antigen in a specimen is below the detection limit of the test or if the specimen was collected or transported improperly, therefore a negative test result does not eliminate the possibility of Covid-19 infection and should be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay or ELISA\nFor more accuracy of immune status additional follow up testing using other laboratory methods is recommended\nFrequently Asked Questions FAQs:\nQ.\n What is an antigen? \nAntigens are proteins that are part of the COVID-19 virus. If the test detects antigens in your swab sample, it means that the COVID-19 virus is present in your body.\nQ.\n Will this test hurt? \nThe nasal swab may cause slight discomfort.

            "description": "Patanjali Ayurveda Giloy Ghanvati\n is an ayurvedic supplement that helps boost immunity and protect from various infections. It helps build strength and stamina to improve energy levels. The tablets aid in post-illness recovery and manage fever, cough, and cold. Giloy, an active ingredient in the tablet, has an antipyretic activity that helps to reduce fever and recover quickly after an infection or illness. It is known to alleviate the symptoms of the common cold, low immunity, general weakness, and fatigue. This ayurvedic tablet is also known to increase platelet count and reduce dengue fever. It also aids in toxin removal, promoting better skin and skin regeneration by increasing collagen production.\nKey Ingredients:\nGiloy\nIndications:\nThis is indicated in cases of general debility, fever, and skin and urinary conditions.\nKey Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nIt can be used for general weakness and the common cold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAids in relieving constipation with mucus in the stool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelps to manage cholesterol levels and keep your heart healthy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is known to lower your risk of recurrent infections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosts your immune system and prevents immune-deficiency disorders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActs as supportive therapy for individuals with autoimmune disorders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt improves your appetite and aids in overall growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlays a key role in the treatment of skin conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelps deal with urinary problems, including urinary tract infections\n\n\n\n\nDosage:\n\n\n\n\nAbove 12 years:\n 1 tablet twice daily\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow 12 years:\n \u00bd tablet twice daily\n\n\n\n\nSafety Information:\n\n\n\n\nRead the label carefully before use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStore in a cool and dry place\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not exceed the recommended dosage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep out of reach of children\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tips:\nAlong with the tablet, it is advised to have a healthy diet loaded with essential nutrients.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nQ. Can giloy be used to reduce a fever?\nGiloy helps in reducing fever due to its javarghana (antipyretic) property. As per ayurveda, two factors lead to high fever, the first is ama and the second is any foreign particle or organism. Giloy helps reduce fever by improving digestion and absorption due to its deepan (appetizer) and pachan (digestive) properties, preventing the formation of ama. It also improves immunity to fight foreign particles or organisms due to its Rasayana property.\nQ. How does Giloy help to manage dengue?\nGiloy helps manage dengue fever thanks to its anti-inflammatory and antipyretic (that reduce fever) properties. Regular intake of giloy during dengue helps improve the immune system and also helps in increasing platelet count. Together, these help to manage dengue fever.\nQ. Can I take giloy on an empty stomach? \nYes. This ayurvedic supplement can be taken on an empty stomach in the morning to alleviate liver disorders, manage fever, and fight stress. However, talk to the doctor to know the right time and dose of this supplement, as it might vary among individuals with different concerns.\nQ. Does giloy help boost immunity?\nYes, giloy being an immunomodulator, helps to regulate and strengthen immunity. It is due to the presence of certain chemical constituents like magnoflorine that activate the lymphocytes or immunity-boosting cells. These cells further help the body to build immunity by fighting against disease-causing pathogens. It also has rasayana (rejuvenation) property which allows your body to develop the tendency to fight back against all viral or bacterial infections and maintain good internal health."

            "description": "It is used to treat digestive disorders such as bloating and chronic indigestion. It is known to improve the digestion of carbohydrates and fats due to the presence of the enzyme called papain. It is also known to help in the treatment of dengue fever due to its ability to improve platelet count, and thus, manage the symptoms.\nKey Ingredients:\nCarica papaya\nCaripill tablet contains Carica Papaya leaf extract which contains the enzyme papain. Papain is proteolytic, meaning that it digests (non-living) proteins. This enzymatic preparation improves digestion in general and has also been used to treat less serious digestive disorders like bloating and chronic indigestion. Papaya leaf also shows promise as an aid in combating ulcers. The softening and disintegrating qualities of papain with an alkaline combination can aid in the treatment of dyspepsia.\nPapaya leaf is used to increase low blood platelet count in Dengue fever and Chikungunya. Low platelet count means that the blood possesses too few thrombocytes or specialized blood cells called platelets. These cells play a key role in blood clotting and lack of sufficient quantities of these cells in the blood can increase the risk of bleeding.\nThe supplement is usually safe when taken as recommended by your doctor. It can be taken by people across all age groups, but talk to your doctor if you suffer from any chronic health conditions. If your symptoms fail to show improvement or if you experience any side effects, then do inform your doctor without fail. Keep it away from the reach of children and use it under medical supervision.\nKey ingredients:\nEranda Karkati (carica papaya Lf.): 1100 mg\nKey benefits/uses of Caripill tablet:\nPromotes digestion by aiding the breakdown of carbohydrates and fats\nContains papain, an enzyme that helps in the digestion of proteins\nImproves the symptoms of acidity (dyspepsia)\nAids in the treatment of chronic indigestion and bloating\nImproves platelet count, thereby helping in the treatment of dengue\nDirections for use:\nTake this supplement as advised by your doctor. Ideally, adults are advised to take 1 tablet thrice daily or as directed by a physician.\nQuick tips for Caripill tablets:\nAlong with the tablet, it is advised to have a healthy diet loaded with essential nutrients.\u00a0\nTake the medicine at the same time every day to help you remember to take it.\nFollow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully to get the most out of this medication.\nTell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking as they may affect or be affected by this medicine.\nRead the label carefully before use, and do not exceed the recommended dosage of the tablet.\nAlways use this medicine under medical supervision.\nDo not take these supplements if you are allergic to this medicine or any other ingredients present in it.\nIn case you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose at the scheduled time.\nSide effects of Caripill Tablets:\nThese tablets are usually safe and don\u2019t cause any side effects when taken as per the doctor's recommendation. However, if your symptoms fail to show any improvement or if you experience any symptoms post taking this supplement, then inform your doctor.\nStorage and safety information:\nRead the label carefully before use.\nDo not exceed the recommended dose.\nKeep out of the reach and sight of children.\nFAQs related to Caripill Tablets:\nQ. How does Caripill work?\nCaripill contains Carica papaya leaf extract which is used in thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) associated with dengue. It has been found to increase platelet production by increasing the activity of genes that are responsible for platelet production.\n\u00a0\nQ. Is Caripill good for dengue treatment?\n\u00a0Yes, Caripill is good for dengue as it helps in the improvement of platelet count which falls significantly in dengue. Symptoms of dengue include a severe headache, severe eye pain (behind eyes), joint pain, rashes on the skin, mild bleeding from the nose or gums. Caripill restores the normal platelet count, and thus, the symptoms of dengue start subsiding slowly over a period of time. Regular monitoring of platelet count is very important along with Caripill treatment.\nQ. Does Caripill contain papaya extract?\nYes, Caripill contains papaya extract which makes it useful in the management of dengue as it helps in restoring platelet count which falls during dengue. However, to monitor whether the medicine is working well or not, regular monitoring of platelet count and blood cell count is very essential.\u00a0\nQ. For how long I need to take Caripill?\nYou can take Caripill until the platelet count reaches a normal level or until you become free from the symptoms of dengue. Keep monitoring your platelet count regularly and if you observe no change in platelet count, immediately consult your doctor.\u00a0\nQ. Can I take metformin with Caripill?\nNo, it is not advisable to take Caripill with metformin. Some studies have shown that co-administration may lead to very low blood glucose levels. So, it is better to avoid metformin when you are taking Caripill.\u00a0\nQ. Can I use Caripill for cancer?\nNo, Caripill is not indicated in the treatment of cancer.\u00a0 It is known to help in the treatment of dengue by restoring the platelet count, however, its role in cancer treatment is not well established.\nQ. Can I take Caripill with paracetamol (PCM)?\nYes, you can take Caripill with paracetamol. Carica papaya in Caripill is useful in the management of dengue as it helps in restoring platelet count which falls during dengue. Whereas, paracetamol is an NSAID that reduces fever.\u00a0\nQ. Can I take Caripill for dengue fever?\nNo, Caripill is not used in dengue fever. Carica papaya in Caripill only works to restore platelet count which significantly falls during dengue. For fever associated with Dengue, please consult your doctor and take paracetamol.\nReferences:\nPapaya."
