It is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of COVID-19 antigen in nasal swab specimen directly from individuals with or without symptoms or with other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19. The user will get the test results within 20 minutes from the safety of their own house. The test reports can be checked using the MyLab app. Both testing materials, a guidelines for use (IFU) leaflet, and a biohazard bag to properly dispose of test materials will be included with each package. To minimise pain, the procedure is intended to be performed using a nasal swab rather than a deep nasopharyngeal swab.",
        "Directions for Use": "Test preparation: Wash your hands and make sure they are dry before starting the test procedure. Tear the pouch and keep the individual components ready for testing. Open the MyLab Coviself app and fill in the credentials (All fields are mandatory as per ICMR). Open the pouch containing the test device(cassette). Scan the OR code on the cassette to link the code with your credentials. Find the pre-filled buffer tube and remove it out of the pouch and tap vertically on the horizontal surface, to make sure the extraction buffer settles at the bottom of the tube. Unscrew the cap and hold the tube in your hand. Do not spill the content of the tube. Step 1: Open the swab package from the tail end and take the swab out (Do not touch the swab head). Sampling with a nasal swab: Using the sterile swab provided in the kit, carefully insert the swab into one nostril. The swab tip should be inserted up to 2-4cm or until resistance is met. Roll the swab 5 times inside the nostril to ensure that cells are collected. Using the same swab, repeat this process for the other nostril to ensure that an adequate sample is collected from both the nasal cavities. Withdraw the swab from the nasal cavity. The specimen is now ready for testing using the extraction buffer provided in the test kit. Step 2: Take the nasal swab and dip in the pre-filled extraction tube. Pinch the tube at the bottom and swirl the nasal swab 10 times ensuring the swab is immersed well in the extraction buffer. Find the breakpoint of the swab. Break the swab at the breakpoint. Discard the remainder of the swab. Mix well. Step 3: Do not leave the test device unused once opened for more than 5 minutes. Add 2 full drops of extracted antigen buffer mixture into the sample well of the test device, by pressing the tube and wait for 10-15min for the results to appear. Read the results within 20 minutes. Strong positive results can be reported within 10-15 minutes. Results that appear after 20 minutes are not valid (Phone will give you the alarm to capture the test results). Step 4: Take the test device and click a picture (Wait for the app to analyse and display your COVID-19 test results). The swab is inserted in the lysis buffer which destroys the COVID-19/respiratory viruses. This tube (with swab head inside), is to be put inside the waste disposal bag and this bag can be thrown in the household waste",

        "Directions for Use": "The following instructions are the test procedure to complete a single test. The 4 tests, 10 tests and 20 tests kits include components to complete multiple tests. If more than one individual will be tested, separate the test components to avoid confusion. Before starting: Scan the QR code on page 1 to download the NAVICA app. Open the app and follow the prompts to complete the test Wash or sanitize your hands. Make sure they are dry before starting Prepare for the test: Check the expiration date on the box. Do not use it if the kit is expired Ensure the kit is at room temperature for at least 30 minutes prior to use. Open the box and remove 1 each of the components to perform a single test. Do not open individual components until instructed Note: A timing device (clock, timer, etc.) is required, but not provided Keep buffer bottle upright, twist and pull tab to open the bottle Squeeze the liquid from the buffer bottle into the tube. You will need to squeeze at least twice Note: Check the liquid level. The liquid should be at or slightly above the fill line on the side of the tube Put the Tube into the tube rack before proceeding to the next step Collect the Nasal Sample: Keep fingers away from the swab end Open swab protective package at stick end. Take the swab out Swab both nostrils. Insert the soft end of the swab straight back into your nostril until resistance is felt (about 2cm). Slowly rotate the swab, gently rubbing it along the insides of your nasal passage at least 5 times. Remove the swab from the nostril Using the same swab, repeat the above step in your other nostril. Check: Did you swab BOTH nostrils? Insert the swab into the tube. Swirl in the fluid 5 or more times while pushing against the wall of the tube. Pinch the swab tip through the tube to remove any remaining fluid Hold the tube firmly with one hand. Lift the swab and locate the break line. Snap the swab handle at the break line. Leave the swab in the tube and discard the stick Note: After the swab is inserted in the buffer, the inactivation properties of the buffer plus the physical barrier of the closed extraction tube, help neutralize the COVID-19 virus Secure the Blue Cap on the top of the Tube. Return the Tube to the Tube Rack before proceeding to the next step Perform the test: Remove the Test Device from its protective package and place it on a well-lit, flat surface Check liquid for bubbles. Wait for any bubbles to disappear as they can lead to inaccurate results. Keep the Tube vertical with the white cap pointed down. Remove the white cap. Do not move the Test Device until the test is finished Squeeze 5 drops of liquid from the Tube into the well on the Test Device. Secure white cap back on Tube and wait 15 minutes Note: If clogging occurs, gently tap the bottom of the tube to release the blockage. Do not touch the Test Device during this period Keep the Test Device flat on the table. After 15 minutes, use the NAVICA app to take a photo of the Test Device and submit your result. The app will automatically submit your result to ICMR and display your test result. Do not read the result earlier than 15 minutes or after 20 minutes Note: A Control (C) line may appear in the result window within a few minutes but a Test (T) line may take as long as 15 minutes to appear. Note: After 20 minutes the result might become inaccurate Read the test result: Invalid Result (test did not work) Find the result window. If NO Control (C) line is present, the test did not work and is considered Invalid. This may be the result of an incorrect test procedure and the test should be repeated. Positive Result Find the result window and look carefully for two lines. Positive Result: If you see two lines, Control (C) line and Test (T) line, this means COVID-19 was detected. If positive, please contact your doctor or local health department immediately and follow local guidelines for self-isolation. Negative Result Find the result window and look for a single line in the window. Negative Result: If you see only the Control (C) line is present, this means COVID-19 was not detected. If the rapid antigen test results are negative and symptoms continue, individuals should immediately be tested by RT-PCR per ICMR Advisory. You are also advised to continue following local guidelines for self-isolation and consult your doctor. Dispose of the test kit: Place swab, tube and test device into the bag Seal the bag tightly Throw away the bag in the waste bin",
